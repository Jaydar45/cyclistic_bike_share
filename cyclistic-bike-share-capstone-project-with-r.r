In order to complete this case study, I will be using my understanding of the Data Analysis prosecess which according to the Google Data Analytics Professional Course are; ***Ask***, ***Prepare***, ***Process***, ***Analyze***, ***Share*** and ***Act***. \n\n## **Scenario**\n\nI am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will\ndesign a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.\n\n## **Characters and teams**\n\n● **Cyclistic**: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. \n \n● **Lily Moreno**: The director of marketing and my manager.\n\n● **Cyclistic marketing analytics team**: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy.\n\n● **Cyclistic executive team**: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.\n\n## **About the company**\n\nUntil now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.\n\nCyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.\n\nMoreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.\n\n# **Ask**\n\n### **Questions to guide our analysis**\nI have to answer the following questions to achieve the business task.\n1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?\n2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?\n3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?\n\n### **Business Task** \nThe primary business task is to:\n\n1. Analyze Cyclistic's historical bike trip data to understand the differences in usage patterns between annual members and casual riders.\n2. Identify the motivations and factors that lead casual riders to purchase Cyclistic annual memberships.\n3. Develop effective digital media strategies that can influence casual riders to transition into becoming annual members.\n\n# **Prepare**\n\n### **Data Source** \nI made use of Cyclistic's historical data from January 2022 to December 2022 for this project. The data was downloaded from divvy and the dataset can be accessed [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). It is an open data so it is accessible to the public.\n\n### **Data Organization**\nThe data is kept in csv files separated by month. All files contain usage of Cyclistic bikes including ride type, start and end stations (with station IDs and coordinates), as well as whether users are members or casual riders. Upon inspection of the 2022 files, however, it has been determined that some start and end points do not have names and IDs. All observations, nonetheless, have lat and long coordinates.\n\n### **Data Integrity and Credibility**\nGoing by the ROCCC standards:\n1. It is **Reliable** as coordinates are present across all transactions eventhough the IDs and station names are missing for a lot of rows in the dataset. If there is a need to identify the station names and IDs of the missing values, we can simply match their coordinates to the coordinates of transactions with existing stations names/IDs.\n2. It is **Original**; it belongs to Cyclistic so its a first party data.\n3. It is **Comprehensive**. I am only working with 2022 data but record goes back to 2013.\n4. It is **Current** because it was updated last month.\n5. It is **Cited**. As I mentioned earlier, this is a first party data.\n\n# **Process**\n\nIn order to process the 5,667,717 total records for 2022, spreadsheets wouldn’t be able to handle the sheer amount of data. I had to make use of Rstudio instead.\n\nThe first step was to install & load the packages required for this process, which in this case were: **Tidyverse**, **Janitor** & **Lubridate**.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#install the packages\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\ninstall.packages(\"janitor\")\ninstall.packages(\"lubridate\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-23T11:27:25.744254Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-23T11:27:25.746144Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-23T11:28:07.714892Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#load the packages\nlibrary(tidyverse) #helps wrangle data\nlibrary(janitor)#helps clean column names\nlibrary(lubridate)#helps wrangle date attributes\nlibrary(ggplot2) #helps visualize data","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-23T11:28:07.719398Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-23T11:28:07.721743Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-23T11:28:07.743938Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I tried uploading the dataset to kaggle for the purpose of this analysis after downloading them from divvy, but found out that it has been uploaded already by another kaggle user [Fernando Martinez](https://www.kaggle.com/fernandomartinezt) so I simply made use of his.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#import the csv datasets\n#df_name <- read_csv(dataset_location)\n\nJan_2022 <- read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/google-casestudy-1-2022-2023/202201-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\nFeb_2022 <- read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/google-casestudy-1-2022-2023/202202-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\nMar_2022 <- read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/google-casestudy-1-2022-2023/202203-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\nApr_2022 <- read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/google-casestudy-1-2022-2023/202204-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\nMay_2022 <- read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/google-casestudy-1-2022-2023/202205-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\nJun_2022 <- read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/google-casestudy-1-2022-2023/202206-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\nJul_2022 <- read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/google-casestudy-1-2022-2023/202207-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\nAug_2022 <- read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/google-casestudy-1-2022-2023/202208-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\nSep_2022 <- read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/google-casestudy-1-2022-2023/202209-divvy-publictripdata.csv\")\nOct_2022 <- read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/google-casestudy-1-2022-2023/202210-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\nNov_2022 <- read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/google-casestudy-1-2022-2023/202211-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\nDec_2022 <- read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/google-casestudy-1-2022-2023/202212-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-23T11:45:26.167234Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-23T11:45:26.171049Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-23T11:45:58.379146Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To check for descripancies, I had to ascertain if they all share the same column names.
